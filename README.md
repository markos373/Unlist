2. Ensure that you have ```Python 3``` and ```pip``` installed
3. run ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt``` to install dependencies
4. Go to and install a compatible version of [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) and place the ```chromedriver.exe``` executable file in the ```Unlist/src/``` folder. Ensure that it is compatible with your version of Google Chrome

## Dear User
