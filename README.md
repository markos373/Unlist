# Unlist

## Description
Unlist will be the go-to application to help clean up that cluttered, excessively long Gmail inbox. It will unsubscribe from email lists that you no longer want to be a part of so those pesky sites will stop sending you spam. 

## How To Run
1. Install ```Visual Studio 2019``` in order to display the GUI, if prompted you might need to install dependencies or updates for Visual Studio
2. Ensure that you have ```Python 3``` and ```pip``` installed
3. run ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt``` to install dependencies
4. Go to and install a compatible version of [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) and place the ```chromedriver.exe``` executable file in the ```Unlist/src/``` folder. Ensure that it is compatible with your version of Google Chrome

## Dear User
The GUI will prompt you for your Gmail email and password. Note that this program does NOT store any of your information! Thanks for trying out Unlist and happy unsubscribing...
